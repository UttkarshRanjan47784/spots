# Spots!

My solution to a react challenge video I saw on YouTube. A good challenge, I was able to solve it on my first try, quite easy yet very interesting!

- YouTube Channel Name : Web Dev Cody
- Challenge Video Link : (https://youtu.be/QNYljS0_TOE?si=VbxnQHGGg2sqi0v4)

- Click anywhere on the available screen to mark that point with a circle!
- Undo and Redo functions are available.
- Made using ReactJS and Tailwind CSS.
- Responsive UI.

- This is my own solution. Did not see answer. Did not take any hints. Did not copy code.
